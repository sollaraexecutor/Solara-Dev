# Solara-Dev  

Hello testers/Developers.

if you are in this page, this means your a selected tester or a developer yourself, if you are a tester make sure to report back any problems to the user that send you this GitHub.

The download wont be very successful due to windows thinking Solara is a virus, this is because of the new DLL/API this executor uses.
So make sure to disable your antivirus for no further problems.

If the executor doesn't open or the files didn't extract, just leave it there for now, make sure to report it back again to the one who sent you this file Also if someone sends you a Fake version message (breases.) .
